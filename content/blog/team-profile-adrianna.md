### Interviewer: Abhi Vaidyanatha, PlanetScale Software Engineer
### Interviewee: Adrianna Tan, PlanetScale Senior Product Manager

**Abhi: Hi Adrianna, thanks for the time! We're gonna tell the internet a little about you!**

Adrianna: Sounds good!

**Abhi: So starting off easy... what drew you to PlanetScale?**

Adrianna: After having spent a lot of my career in front-facing consumer technology, I was very curious about being on the other side. I wanted to be in a position where I could learn a lot about back-end infrastructure first-hand. I've known Jiten (PlanetScale CEO) for a couple of years through a bunch of mutual friends across the world, so I always spent time with his family when I came to the Bay area. Hearing him always talk about technology made me want to find out more about it!

**Abhi: Yeah that makes sense - I feel like Jiten knows everyone one way or another! So why don't you tell everyone a little about what you do here?**

Adrianna: Like with any early stage startup, I do pretty much anything. I'm mainly helping out with sales, legal processes, marketing, and channeling my background as a company founder to make sure that all our bases as a new company are covered.

**Abhi: Interesting, tell me more about the company you founded!"

Adrianna: In 2013 a friend and I were really interested in taking action on social issues in India; educating girls has always been a key prioirty for us. There’s a lot of NGOs that do this, but we wanted to specifically target 10-11 year olds due to their disproportionally high dropout rate from school. We’ve worked with more than 150 girls, paying for their education and ensuring their academid success. Now we’re moving on to pilot programs that teach them more technical skills. To test this, we are starting a programming class with 25 of them!

**Abhi: That's an amazing cause - why are girls of that specific age group dropping out so often?**

Adrianna: It's often a lot of really silly issues. Because of the lack of sanitation, separate bathrooms for women, and lack of education, parents feel unsafe sending their children to school. In addition, the culture usually supports women getting married early, so education is not viewed as a priority. Interestingly enough, although low-income tribal families are often lumped into the same bucket as low-income bottom-caste individuals, the tribal families are often much more progressive in terms of female agency. There are a lot of unique nuances about this problem that need to be approached and I think our mission enables us to provide very directed help to a group held back by regressive practices.

**Abhi: It's strange how geographically and culturally complex the issue is.**

Adrianna: Yeah, very often when we talk about what we do to upper class people, they want us to use their money to send kids to high class establishments... which is really not feasible. Most individuals are fairly out of touch with these issues.

**Abhi: Understandable - perspective does not often come packaged with privilege. So if you had to teach a class to a bunch of entitled Silicon Valley people, what would it be about?**

Adrianna: Cartography. I would show them a world map to explain that there's a world outside of Silicon Valley and that the world is bigger than them. Additionally, I would explain how to apply technology to places outside of their direct reach.

**Abhi: (laughing) Yes, I do feel that the general culture here is extremely insular. So what other startups have you been a part of?**

Adrianna: I worked at Uber and Yelp when they were both starting up in Singapore. Additionally, I worked at an Australia crowdfunding startup as a manager.

**Abhi: Interesting, so have you always traveled this much? Where did your love for travel come from?**

Adrianna: I left my home country for the first time when I was 7... We went to Borneo and took public transits through the jungle - I'm pretty sure I lost a few of my baby teeth due to how bumpy the ride was. My mom taught me how to be street smart; she has a GPS installed in her brain for every city that she goes to, so she can get anywhere by public transit. Being exposed to a lot of the world in rough environments with few resources really helped shape me into who I am. I've visited and have done work in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, and the Indian state of Bihar - not the most inviting environments to women. 

**Abhi: That's beyond cool.**

Adrianna: My parents didn't always think so. I've given them a lot of heart attacks.

**Abhi: Yeah, it seems like they are pretty supportive though!**

Adrianna: Definitely. One time in a bar in India, a man randomly asked if I wanted to travel to the rainiest place in India for a news article and I had to ask my dad to sponsor me. He was understandably tentative, but let me do it anyway. I spent a few weeks there and we ended up getting featured on Geographical (UK's equivalent of NatGeo) for our work. 

**Abhi: Seems like it was worth it for sure. Have you been published a lot?**

Adrianna: I was featured in Wired magazine for my strong evangelism for Apple products - I sold quite a few Macs when working for the Apple Store in Singapore. I used to run a fairly well-known blog that I started when I was 15, which received a fair amount of attention.

**Abhi: So what brought people to [your blog?](https://popagandhi.com)**

Adrianna: It was the combination of a few factors. First off, there were very few bloggers from my part of the world at the time, so the novelty definitely got me a few views. Additionally, I had an interesting perspective about technology, being queer in Singapore, and traveling all over the world. I was the first queer woman to talk about being queer in Singapore, so that likely stood out. Back then, a lot of people knew me by my online persona... which was kinda weird.

**Abhi: When you put it that way, it makes a lot of sense. Wasn't it scary to out yourself on the internet, let alone being the first one to do it?**

Adrianna: It's interesting really. I'm just physically not afraid of some things that a lot of people care about. My brain just doesn't process these emotions! Later in my life I learned that you are supposed to care about these things... but it never hit me that I was supposed to.

**Abhi: That's awesome. I'm sure you've inspired a lot of people in similar situations.**

Adrianna: A few women actually emailed me and said that my blog inspired them to travel on their own. My [post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkGKPagtzEs) on my trip to Yemen is a good example of that.

**Abhi: Must have been a crazy experience, I'm not surprised that you had a ton of followers! Ok last question - what are you currently working on outside of work?**

Adrianna: I like the idea of building things with my hands, so right now I really want to learn how to be a carpenter! I was always really interested in cycling and wasn't completely sure how they work so I spent time putting my own bike together recently. When I have time, I'm a huge fan of playing Overcooked, XCOM, and the latest Wolfenstein game.

**Abhi: I've definitely wanted to try out Overcooked, so I'll pick that up when I get home! In any case, thanks for the chat Adrianna - it was fun talking to you.**

Adrianna: Yeah, of course!
