## About You

You are all about backend infrastructure.  Architecture is described in terms of scalability, performance, security, resource management.  CAP theorem is a fact of life for you.  You think in data models, and can convincingly describe why and when you’d use normalized and denormalized schemas. You dream of building high availability distributed services that scale and scale and scale.


## What You’ll Be Doing
PlanetScale’s goal is to make it a breeze to deploy and operate Vitess/MySQL clusters on premise as well as in cloud.  Your job is to make sure our infrastructure and architecture scales to meet those and many more demands, especially as we support multiple clouds and evolve the platform where we can run our own database as a service based on Vitess.

You will be:
- Leveraging Golang and Python to build scalable, secure software.
- Building on top of our architecture stack, including Kubernetes, AWS, GCP and Azure.
- Building out and iterating on the PlanetScale Deployment Platform for easily deploying and operating Vitess/MySQL clusters.

## Who we look for

- What’ll Help You Be Successful
- Ability to manage time efficiently and focus on clear goals
- Pragmatic approach towards tackling unforeseen challenges
- Experience with Golang and Python
- Experience developing and or operating distributed systems at scale
- Experience with MySQL and SQL.
- Infinite appetite for learning
