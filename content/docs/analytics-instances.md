# Analytics instances

## What is an analytics instance?

An **analytics instance** is a copy of your database for offline analytics. An analytics instance can improve your database performance by handling long-running batch and analytics queries, so that these do not slow down your database.

A [database-instance](database-instances) is similar to an analytics instance, but serves live queries rather than batch queries.
