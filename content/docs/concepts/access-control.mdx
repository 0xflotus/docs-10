## Overview

When you set up your PlanetScale account, you're asked to create an **Organization**. 

An organization is essentially a container for your databases, settings, and members. You can create multiple organizations in the same account for different applications or use cases. Within each organization, you can add members and assign them different roles. For even more control, you can [assign roles at the database level](#database-administrator) within each organization as well.

## Roles and permissions

We currently support three different roles in your organization:

- [`Organization Member`](#organization-member) &mdash; Can perform limited actions in an organization and on all databases in that organization
- [`Database Administrator`](#database-administrator) &mdash; Can perform all actions in the database that they administrate
- [`Organization Administrator`](#organization-administrator) &mdash; Can perform all actions in an organization and on all databases in an organization

Each role has a set of permissions assigned to it which determine what actions that role is allowed to take within an organization or database.

### Organization Member

A member with the `Organization Member` role can only perform limited actions in an organization and on all databases in the organization.

You can find the complete set of permissions available to an Organization Member in the table below:

#### Organization-level permissions

| Permissions | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `show_service_token` | some description |
| `list_service_tokens` | some description |
| `create_service_token` | some description |
| `destroy_service_token` | some description |
| `list_service_token_grants` | some description |
| `show_service_token_grant` | some description |
| `create_service_token_grant` | some description |
| `destroy_service_token_grant` | some description |
| `update_service_token_grant` | some description |
| `show_organization` | some description |
| `list_organization_members` | some description |
| `show_organization_member` | some description |
| `list_organization_audit_logs` | some description |

#### Database-level permissions

| Permissions | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `list_database_members` | some description |
| `show_database_members` | some description |
| `request_deploy` | some description |
| `show_branch` | some description |
| `show_database` | some description |
| `create_branch` | some description |
| `destroy_branch` | some description |
| `list_query_stats` | some description |

### Database Administrator

A member with the `Database Administrator` role can perform all actions on the database for which they were assigned the `Database Administrator` role.

This role is assigned at the **database level** and therefore **does not** have any organization-level permissions. If you want to [grant a member access to manage one or several databases](#assign-roles-at-a-database-level), but not the organization, then this is the role you want.

#### Database-level permissions

A Database Administrator has all of the ["Database-level permissions" that an Organization Member](#organization-member) has, as well as the following:

| Permissions | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `update_database` | some description |
| `destroy_database` | some description |
| `add_database_member` | some description |
| `remove_database_member` | some description |
| `update_database_member` | some description |
| `promote_branch` | some description |
| `destroy_production_branch` | some description |
| `update_database_billing` | some description |

### Organization Administrator

An Organization Administrator can perform all actions in an organization, as well as all actions on _every_ database within that organization. To see a full list of the database-level permissions, refer to the [Database Administrator list of permissions](#database-administrator). 

#### Organization-level permissions

An Organization Administrator has all of the ["Organization-level permissions" that an Organization Member](#organization-member) has, as well as the following:

| Permissions | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `update_organization` | some description |
| `destroy_organization` | some description |
| `update_organization_member` | some description |
| `remove_organization_member` | some description |
| `invite_organization_member` | some description |
| `cancel_organization_invite` | some description |
| `list_organization_invitations` | some description |
| `update_sso` | some description |
| `list_billing_sources` | some description |

| `list_billing_summaries` | some description |
| `list_organization_invoices` | some description |
| `download_organization_invoice` | some description |
| `create_production_service_token_grant` | some description |

## Assign organization roles to members

You can follow the steps below to assign roles to your members. You must be an Organization Administrator to modify member roles.

- In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com/), click on the Settings tab in the top navigation. 
- Click on "Members" in the sidebar on the left.
- From here, you can click on the dropdown on the right under the "Role" column to select the role you want to apply to each member.

You can also invite new members to your organization and assign roles once they accept their invitation. New members will be added with the [`Organization Member`](#organization-member) role by default.

<InfoBlock type="note">
  Member role management is issued at the organization level. Each organization in your account may have different members with different access levels.
</InfoBlock>

## Assign roles at a database level

To assign a member the role of `Database Administrator`, follow the steps outlined below. You must be an Organization Administrator or an existing Database Administrator to manage the `Database Administrator` role. 

- In the [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com/), click on the name of the database you want to add a Database Administrator to.
- Click on the "Settings" tab in the top navigation.
- Click on "Administrators" in the sidebar on the left.
