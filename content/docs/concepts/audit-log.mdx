## Overview
The organization audit log grants organization administrators access to review `actions` performed by individual members of the organization. In addition, each audit log includes `events` detailing who performed the `action` and when it happened.

Audit log events are retained for 15 days in your PlanetScale account.

## Review your organization audit log
You can review your organization audit log under your PlanetScale `organization` settings:`app.planetscale.com/<org>/settings/audit-log`. 

Once there, you can filter the audit log by `Actor` and/or `Action`.

Clicking and expanding individual log `event` names empowers you to investigate additional metadata that can provide broader context around what changed.
