## Overview

PlanetScale offers a free *Developer* plan with a generous **25GB of storage**. Our paid *Scaler* plan is priced based on the number of `reads`/`writes` and amount of storage, with an additional monthly flat fee. This scalable, pay-as-you-grow model means you'll never have to over-provision resources.

### PlanetScale charges on three factors

- **Reads**: Retrieving or inspecting rows during a query or mutation of any kind to your PlanetScale databases.
- **Writes**: Adding new information or changing existing information in your PlanetScale databases.
- **Storage**: Data saved in the form of tables, columns, rows, and their corresponding relationships.

## PlanetScale plans

PlanetScale applies billing plans at the **database level**. You can create several databases under one account/organization. The usage charges will be scoped to each database, so each database will have its own separate billing page.

We offer three plans, outlined below:

|                      | **Developer**: Free  | **Scaler**: Pay as you grow    | **Enterprise**: Custom                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage/month**    | 10GB                 | 25GB + $1.25 per additional 1GB | Configurable                                  |
| **Read rows/month**  | 100m                 | 500m + $1.50 per additional 10m | Configurable                                  |
| **Write rows/month** | 10m                  | 50m + $1.50 per additional 1m   | Configurable                                  |
| **Branches**         | 3 per database       | 10 per database                 | _Unlimited_                                   |
| **Connections**      | 1,000                | 10,000                          | Configurable                                  |
| **Automated Backups**| Daily                | Every 12 hours                  | Configurable                                  |
| **Support**          | Community            | Email                           | Premium                                       |
| **Monthly fee**      | $0/mo                | $29 per database                | [Contact us](https://planetscale.com/contact) |

<InfoBlock type="note">
  You are limited to 1 free database per organization.

All plans are billed on a **monthly basis**. 

For more information about the `Enterprise` plan, please [contact our sales team](https://www.planetscale.com/contact). For an overview of each plan's complete offerings and FAQ, [check out the pricing page](https://planetscale.com/pricing).

<InfoBlock type="note">
  Plans are priced <b>per database</b>. The total charge for a PlanetScale <em>database</em> includes the charge for
  usage on <b>database branches</b>. In other words, the total reads, writes, and storage used by each branch of your database will determine the final monthly price.

## Plan add-ons

To make sure our plans work for your unique use case, we also offer options to customize your Scaler plan.

### Branch packs

The Scaler plan comes with 10 branches per database. You can add additional branches to your Scaler plan in **packs of 5** for an extra $25/mo per pack.

**To add a branch pack to a database:**

1. Go to [your billing page for that database](#find-your-database-billing-page)
2. Select the number of branch packs you'd like to add
3. Click "Save".

### User scheduled backups

We run automatic daily backups for every branch for free. On the Scaler plan, we run automated backups every 12 hours.

You can also [schedule additional backups yourself](/concepts/back-up-and-restore#create-manual-backups) as needed. For these additional user-scheduled backups, we charge $0.023 per GB per month.

## Database billing page

Each database has its own billing page, from which you can:

- Enter/update your credit card information
- See a history of your invoices, as well as the current invoice
- Customize your add-ons

**To find your billing page:**

1. Go to your [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com)
2. Select the database
3. Click on "Settings" in the top nav
4. Click on "Usage and billing" in the side nav

### PlanetScale invoice details

Invoices provide line items for both usage and discounts received. Each line item shows both **metric and database branch level** granularity. 

For example, you may have the following line items:

- Rows _read_ for `main` branch
- Rows _read_ for `your-test-branch`

In addition, storage per branch has two line items:
  - Storage usage per GB
  - Prorated discounts, if the branch existed for a smaller time period than the billing period

Storage is prorated by a percentage equal to the existence of a branch's hours/billing period in hours.

### Download an invoice

You have the option to download invoices as a _PDF_ or _CSV_ file.

To download an invoice, go to [your billing page](#find-your-database-billing-page) (`Organization > Database > Settings > Usage`) and scroll down to the _Invoices_ section.

Click on the arrow on the right next to the invoice you want to download. It will expand and you'll see the option to download at the bottom.

<InfoBlock type="note">
  PlanetScale generates both current and past invoices. Even for the <b>free</b>{' '}
  plan! You can see the cost had you not been on the Developer plan.

## Usage and usage limits

Each PlanetScale plan provides different feature and usage limits. If you accidentally surpass your plan's limits, you'll receive a warning notification and your database will be marked as in overage. If you do not upgrade your plan within 7 days of receiving the notification, PlanetScale will "degrade service" to your database by putting it into `read only` mode. At this point, all `writes` are disabled and all _migrations_ are halted.

When placed in `read only` mode, the databases you have deployed in PlanetScale and any data they contain, are not impacted by this change. `Writes` are disabled, and all branch/database creation is temporarily halted.

<InfoBlock type="warning">
  Your PlanetScale service only gets throttled if your usage exceeds the limits
  designated within your plan.
