## Overview

After a period of inactivity, free databases will be put to sleep. All data will be backed up and stored, but you will not be able to connect to the database.

## What is database sleeping

When a database on the [free Developer plan](/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans) is inactive for 15 days, the database will be put to sleep. When a database is sleeping, all data is backed up, but you **will not be able to connect to any branches on the database** until it has been woken up.

### What happens to my data?

Right before a database is put to sleep, we make a backup of all data, even if it's outside of the [included backup schedule](/concepts/back-up-and-restore). We will continue to store all data while the database is sleeping. Once you wake the database, all data will be restored.

## When do we sleep databases

Here is the criteria we use to determine when a database is put to sleep:

- The database is on the [**free** Developer plan](/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans)
- The database is at least **one month old**
- There have been **no rows written or connections** to any branches of the database in the past **15 days**

If the database meets all of this criteria, it will be put to sleep.

## How to prevent a database from sleeping

To prevent a database from being put to sleep, make sure to connect to any branch of the database at least once every 15 days.

Because database sleeping only applies to databases on the free Developer plan, another option is to upgrade your database to the [paid Scaler plan](/concepts/billing#planetscale-plans).

## How to wake a sleeping database

Once your database is sleeping, you can wake it in your PlanetScale dashboard.

### Steps to wake a sleeping database:

1. Go to your [PlanetScale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com)
2. Click on the sleeping database on the overview page
3. Click the "**Wake database**" button
4. Your database will wake up in the same state it was prior to sleeping and will be available to connect to shortly.
