# Availability features of PlanetScaleDB

This document provides an overview of the availability features of PlanetScaleDB.

## Overview

PlanetScaleDB availability depends on the number of [database instances](/psdb/database-instances) you create for your database.

## Availability levels

PlanetScaleDB offers the following availability levels. The number of database instances you select when you [create your database](/psdb/creating-database) determines the availability level for your database.

### Level 1 Availability

- 1 database instance
- 99.95% availability
- No cross-zone survivability

### Level 2 Availability

- 2 database instances
- 99.95% availability
- Cross-zone survivability
- 2x read scaling

### Level 3 Availability

- 3 database instances
- 99.95% availability
- Cross-zone survivability
- 3x read scaling

## Cross-zone survivability

Cloud providers divide their networks into (availability) zones and regions, which contain multiple zones. Cross-zone survivability means that, if one of the zones that contains one of your database instances fails, your database will survive.

## Read scaling

Database instances beyond 3 continue to provide linear increase to read capacity. For example, 4 database instances provide 4x read capacity compared to 1 database instance, and so on.
