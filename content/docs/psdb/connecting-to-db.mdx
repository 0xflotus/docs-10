# Connect to your database

This document describes how to connect to your PlanetScaleDB [database](databases) or [Database Link](database-links) using a MySQL connection string.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes you have [created a database](creating-database).

This document uses the [MySQL command line client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) as an example MySQL client; however, you can connect to your database using any MySQL client.

## Overview

To create a Database, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [PlanetScale console](https://console.planetscale.com).
1. Click on your cluster.
1. Click on your database.
1. Click the **Connect** button.
1. Click the **Copy** button next to your connection string.
1. Paste the connection string into a MySQL client.
1. Connect to your database using the MySQL client.

## Step 1. Open PlanetScale console.

This opens the **Clusters Overview**.

## Step 2. Click on your cluster name.

This opens the **Overview** for your cluster.

## Step 3. Click on your database name.

This opens the **Overview** for your database.

## Step 4. Click the Connect button.

This opens the connection pane. This pane shows the MySQL connection string for each region and cloud provider where this database is deployed.

## Step 5. Click the Copy button next to your connection string.

Click the **Copy** button next to the connection string for the desired region. This copies the connection string to your clipboard.

## Step 6. Paste the connection string into a MySQL client.

The connection string contains the user credentials for your PlanetScale database, formatted as a MySQL client command line command. To connect to the database with a client, paste the connection string into the appropriate location for your client.

For example, to connect using the MySQL command line client, you can paste the connection string into a your terminal. It should look like the following:

```console
mysql --host abcdefghijklmnop-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com --port 3306 --user vtgate-1-user --password=aAbBcCdDeE12345
```

Note: MySQL [discourages specifying passwords in plaintext on the command line](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/5.7/en/password-security-user.html). To improve password security, configure the MySQL command line to default to your PlanetScale database connection settings. For example:

```console
cat << EOF > ~/.my.cnf
[client]
user=vtgate-1-user
password=aAbBcCdDeE12345
host=abcdefghijklmnop-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
port=3306
EOF
```

## Step 7. Connect to your database using the MySQL client.

Using your MySQL client, request a MySQL connection using the connection string. For example, using the MySQL command line client, enter the command from **Step 5** above. Your MySQL client should indicate that there is now a connection to your PlanetScale database, and prompt for MySQL queries.

For example, assuming that you have a configuration file from **Step 5** above, you can run the MySQL command line client with no arguments, and it will connect to your PlanetScale database:

```console
shell> mysql

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 12669

mysql>
```

You can now issue queries against your PlanetScale database.
