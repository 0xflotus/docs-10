# Create a cluster

Before you can create a database, you must first create a cluster.
This document explains how to create a cluster using the PlanetScale console.

## Overview

To create a cluster, complete the following steps:

1. Open the clusters view.
1. Click **Create Cluster**.
1. Name your cluster.
1. Choose **Single region**, **multi-region and multi-cloud**, or **Custom Kubernetes Region**.
1. Choose cloud providers and regions.
1. Click **Create Cluster**.

## Step 1: Open the clusters view.

When you create a PlanetScale.com account, you are prompted to create a cluster. You can also access this view by going to [console.planetscale.com/clusters](https://console.planetscale.com/clusters).

## Step 3: Name your cluster.

After clicking **Create Cluster**, you are prompted to name your cluster.

The name of your cluster is prepended with your account name, and must be unique.

## Step 4: Select **Single Region**, **Multi-region and Multi-cloud**, or **Custom Kubernetes Region**.

If you want to deploy your database to more than one cloud provider or region, choose **Multi-region and Multi-cloud**. If you want to create a cluster in a custom Kubernetes region on a Kubernetes cluster belonging to your organization, choose **Custom Kubernetes Region.**

## Step 5: Select cloud providers and regions.

If you are creating a **Single Region** cluster, select the cloud provider and region for your cluster.

If you are creating a **Multi-Region and Multi-Cloud** cluster, select each region where you wish to deploy your database. Once you deploy your cluster, you can only deploy databases to the regions you select for that cluster.

In order to use more than one region, you must select at least three total regions. You may select multiple regions in a single cloud provider.

## Step 6: Click **Create Cluster**.

When you have selected a name and region for your cluster, click **Create Cluster**.

## Step 7: Enter credentials for default admin user

Under **Create default admin user**, enter the username and password for the default admin user. This user will have administrator privileges for all databases in the cluster.

## Step 8: (Optional) Edit Advanced Parameters

PlanetScaleDB uses default parameters for your cluster that are appropriate for generic workloads. To customize these settings, including hot row protection, default pool size, streaming pool size, transaction pool size, and sharding scheme edit privileges, click **Edit Advanced Parameters**.

## What's next

Now that you have a cluster, you can [create a database](creating-database).
