# Reconfiguring a database

This document explains how to reconfigure database resources using the PlanetScaleDB console.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes you have an existing [PlanetScaleDB database](databases). You can also [create a new database](creating-database).

## Overview

Once you have a PlanetScaleDB database, you can reallocate resources for the database from the PlanetScaleDB console. This includes CPU, storage, memory, database instances, and analytics instances.

To reconfigure a database, complete the following steps:

1. Open the **Overview** page for a cluster.
1. Select a cluster.
1. Click on the name of the database.
1. Click **Reconfigure**.
1. Modify the resource allocation.
1. Click **Resize Database**.

## Step 1: Open the Overview page for a cluster.

When you create a new cluster, this page opens automatically. Otherwise, log in to the [PlanetScale console](https://console.planetscale.com/).

## Step 2: Select a cluster.

Click on the name of the cluster where your database will run. This will open the overview for the cluster.

## Step 3: Click on the name of the database.

Under **Databases**, click the name of the database you wish to reconfigure.

## Step 4: Click Reconfigure.

Under **Configuration**, click the **Reconfigure** button.

## Step 5: Modify the resource allocation.

In the **Reconfigure Database** pane, modify the resource allocation for the database. You can reallocate the following resources:

- CPU
- RAM
- Storage
- Number of [database instances](database-instances)
- Number of [analytics instances](analytics-instances)

The **Cost per instance** calculator shows the hourly cost for the new configuration.

Storage reallocation takes a few seconds. CPU and RAM reallocation may take several hours.

PlanetScaleDB does not currently support decreasing the storage allocation for a database.

## Step 6: Click Resize Database.

A message appears to confirm that the reconfiguration is successful.
