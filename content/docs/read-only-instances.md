# Read-only instances

## What is a read-only instance?

A **read-only instance** is a copy of your database for offline analytics. A read-only instance can improve your database performance by handling long-running batch and analytics queries, so that these do not slow down your database.

A [replica](replicas) is similar to a read-only instance, but serves live queries rather than batch queries.
