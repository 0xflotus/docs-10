# PlanetScaleDB security features

This document describes the security features of PlanetScaleDB.

## Security features 

PlanetScaleDB is a fully managed scaling database solution. The database runs entirely on PlanetScale's private cloud; your application connects to the database using a standard connection string. Within the PlanetScale private cloud, data is secure at rest on the storage level. In order to secure your application connection to the PlanetScale Database, the server accepts TLS connections.

## Security updates

PlanetScale will update all Vitess components as the Vitess open source project releases updates, including quarterly Vitess updates. PlanetScale will also patch all security issues as they arise outside the normal release schedule. PlanetScale will patch these within three (3) days of an acceptable working patch being submitted upstream.
