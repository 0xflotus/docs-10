## Overview
To migrate data safely and [without downtime](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes), PlanetScale requires that all tables have a unique, not-null key that remains unchanged during the migration. This requirement can cause difficulty if, for example, you attempt to ALTER the primary key of a table with no other unique indexes.

If you attempt to deploy such a schema change, the deploy request will fail with the error `No shared unique key can be found after ALTER! Bailing out`.

## How to change a table's single unique key
Altering a single unique key can be accomplished in 3 steps. Each step is a [separate deploy request](/concepts/branching#deploying-branches).

1. Add a temporary unique key. To change a lone unique key you will first need to add another unique index that PlanetScale can use during the migration. In a new branch, add a new index on a unique column or combination of columns. The indexed columns should not contain null values.

    ```
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_id ON table_name (`column`,`column2`);
    ```

    Deploy this change via a Deploy Request.

2. Alter the original key. Now that you have a second unique index, you can alter the original key. In a new branch, apply your intended schema change.

    Our example drops the existing primary key and replaces it with a compound primary key.

    ```
    ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY KEY(`column`,`column2`);
    ```

    Deploy this change via a Deploy Request.

3. Drop the temporary unique key. After the primary key has been updated, you can remove the temporary unique index that you added in Step 1.

    In a new branch, drop the temporary index.

    ```
    DROP index idx_unique_id ON table_name;
    ```

    Once this deploy request has been deployed, you will have changed your table's unique primary key and removed the temporary unique key created in step 1.

## Why
PlanetScale's non-blocking schema changes works by first creating a ghost table, in the likeness of your original table. The ghost table is then altered to match your changed schema.
We copy over the data from the original table, as well as stream any changes as they happen to the ghost table. Once this ghost table is in sync with the orignal, we swap the tables in place. This safely completes the migration.

To do this, we need to have a consistent primary or unique key across both of the tables to reliability replicate the data over. This is why we require a consistent key when migrating your data.

## Summary
This tutorial provides a three step process for updating a table's single unique key and can be repeated as often as needed.
