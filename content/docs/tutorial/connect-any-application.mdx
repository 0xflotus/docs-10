## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect any application to your PlanetScale database.

## Prerequisites
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:
```zsh
pscale auth login
```
## Connect to your Database
You can use the `pscale connect` command to establish a secure connection to PlanetScale. It will listen on a local port that your application can connect to.

1. Run the following command in the CLI:
```
pscale connect your-db-name main
``` 
This establishes a secure connection and opens a port on your local machine that you can use to connect any MySQL client.

2. Take note of the address it returns to you. By default it is `127.0.0.1:3306`. The CLI will use a different port if `3306` is unavailable.

3. In your application's mysql `config`, use the following to connect:
    - **host:** `127.0.0.1`
    - **port:** `3306` (the value returned to you by pscale connect)
    - **user:** `root`
    - **password:** leave this blank
    - **database:** your-db-name

## Use Planetscale in production
In production, we recommend using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your application's configuration for connecting to PlanetScale.

1. Run the following command in the CLI:
```
pscale connect your-db-name main --execute "node app.js"
```
You can use the `pscale connect` command with the `--execute` command as a wrapper for your application. This will set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, making it available to your app. The `--execute` flag should be set to the command that starts up your application.

2. Feel free to check out the [full example node application here](https://github.com/planetscale/express-example).

3. Find the latest release of `pscale` CLI for your production environment [here](https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases).


## Authentication in production
You will need to create a service token for use in your production environment.

1. Create a PlanetScale service token:
```
pscale service-token create
```

Take note of the service token's **name** and **value** returned to you.

2. Grant that token access to your database:
```
pscale service-token add-access your-token-name connect_production_branch --database your-db-name
```

3. Set the following environment variables in your production environment:
```
PLANETSCALE_ORG=your-org-name
PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_NAME=your-token-name
PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN=your-token-value
```

That's it! Now when running the `pscale connect` command in production, the CLI will use the service token set in your environment variables for authentication.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we learned how to use `pscale connect` to establish a connection to our database, and how to use the `--execute` flag to set a `DATABASE_URL` for our application.

## What's next?
Now that you've successfully connected your application to PlanetScale, it's time to make schema changes to your tables and deploy your application! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables, without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
