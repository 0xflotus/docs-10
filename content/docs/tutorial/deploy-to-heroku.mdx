## Introduction
In this tutorial, we're going to deploy an application to Heroku. If you already have a built app that's running locally, go ahead and use that one for this tutorial.

## Prerequisites
- Install the [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli).
- Authenticate the CLI with the following command:
```zsh
pscale auth login
```
- Setup your application to connect to MySQL using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

## Deploy to Heroku
Let's use the `pscale` CLI on Heroku to establish a secure connection to your database.

1. Create a PlanetScale service token:

```zsh
pscale service-token create
```

Take note of the service token **name** and **value** it returns to you.

2. Grant that token access to your database:

```zsh
pscale service-token add-access your-token-name connect_production_branch --database your-db-name
```

3. Set config vars for your Heroku application:

```
heroku config:set PLANETSCALE_ORG=your-org-name
heroku config:set PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_NAME=your-token-name
heroku config:set PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN=your-token-value
```

<InfoBlock type="note">
  A Note: You'll use your <em>service token</em> to authenticate to your
  database.
</InfoBlock>

4. Add the custom binaries buildpack to your Heroku application:

```
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/tonyta/heroku-buildpack-custom-binaries#v1.0.0
```

5. Add `.custom_binaries` file to the root of your repository with the following:

```zsh
pscale: https://github.com/planetscale/cli/releases/download/v0.36.0/pscale_0.36.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

This command will install the `pscale` CLI into your Heroku application.

6. Add a `Procfile` that initiates your app using pscale:
```
web: pscale connect your-db-name main --execute 'node app.js'
```

<InfoBlock type="tip">
  Tip: Heroku runs this command when starting the app.
</InfoBlock>

As you can see, we chose to use the sample Node.js and Express.js app we built in our previous [Connect Node.js App](connect-nodejs-app) tutorial. That said, this tutorial is language agnostic and may be used with any language.

7. Push to Heroku and you'll have a working app.

Congratulations! You successfully deployed an application to Heroku.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we deployed a simple application to Heroku. We chose to use the sample Node.js and Express.js app we built in our previous [Connect Node.js App](connect-nodejs-app) tutorial. That said, this tutorial is language agnostic and may be used with any language.

## What's next?
Now that you've successfully deployed an application to Heroku, it's time to make more schema changes to your tables! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
