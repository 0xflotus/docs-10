## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect any application to your PlanetScale database with either username and password or client certificates.

## Prerequisites

- The [PlanetScale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli)
- A [PlanetScale database](/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide)

After you install the PlanetScale CLI, sign in with:

```
pscale auth login
```

## Connect with username and password

This section will show you how to create a password for your branch and use those credentials to connect your database to your application.

You can also generate new branch passwords in the PlanetScale UI by following the instructions in our [Connection Strings doc](/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password).

1. Run the following command in the CLI to create a password for your branch.

```
pscale password create <database-name> <branch-name> <credentials-name>
```

<InfoBlock type='note'>
  The <inlineCode>credentials-name</inlineCode> value represents the name of the connection credentials. You can have multiple credentials for a branch, so this gives you a way to categorize them.
</InfoBlock>

2. Take note of the values it returns to you. You won't be able to see this password again.

```
Password production-password was successfully created.
Please save the values below as they will not be shown again

  NAME                  USERNAME       ACCESS HOST URL                     ROLE               PLAIN TEXT
 --------------------- -------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------
  production-password   jp388djdawnod   gxvhbzcxfw01.us-east-2.psdb.cloud   Can Read & Write   pscale_pw_sVkiE_m1111111111111111
```

3. In your application's MySQL `config`, fill in the following values using the console output from the previous step:

   - **host:** `<ACCESS HOST URL>`
   - **port:** `3306`
   - **user:** `<USERNAME>`
   - **password:** `<PLAIN TEXT>`
   - **database:** `<your-db-name>`

4. Ensure you correctly configure TLS / SSL for your specific MySQL driver. See [Connecting to PlanetScale securely](/reference/planetscale-security) for more information.

## Connect using client certificates

You can use the `pscale connect` command to establish a secure connection to PlanetScale. It will listen on a local port that your application can connect to.

1. Run the following command in the CLI:

```
pscale connect <your-db-name> <your-branch-name>
```

This establishes a secure connection and opens a port on your local machine that you can use to connect any MySQL client.

2. Take note of the address it returns to you. By default it is `127.0.0.1:3306`. The CLI will use a different port if `3306` is unavailable.

3. In your application's MySQL `config`, use the following to connect:

   - **host:** `127.0.0.1`
   - **port:** `3306` (the value returned to you by `pscale connect`)
   - **user:** `root`
   - **password:** Leave this blank
   - **database:** `<your-db-name>`

## What's next?

Now that you've successfully connected your application to PlanetScale, it's time to make schema changes to your tables and deploy your application! Learn more about how PlanetScale allows you to make [non-blocking schema changes](/concepts/nonblocking-schema-changes) to your database tables, without locking or causing downtime for production databases.
