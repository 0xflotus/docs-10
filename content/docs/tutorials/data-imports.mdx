## Overview

PlanetScale provides an import tool in the dashboard that allows you to painlessly import an existing cloud-hosted MySQL database into your PlanetScale database.

  Importing a database will <b>not</b> count towards your <inlineCode>read</inlineCode> or <inlineCode>write</inlineCode> usage.

## Import your database

To import an existing database into PlanetScale, first head to your PlanetScale dashboard and click on the "**Import**" button, which will bring you to the **Import Setup page**.

Type in the name for your PlanetScale database and [select a region](/concepts/regions) from the dropdown. Next, you'll fill out some connection information so that we can import your data.

### Set up the connection

Fill in the following values with information from your existing hosted database:

- **Host name** &mdash;
- **Port** &mdash;
- **SSL verification mode** &mdash;
- **Database name** &mdash;
- **Username** &mdash;

You'll have the option to **Authenticate with password** or **Authenticate with mTLS**.

To authenticate with password, type in the password for the username you entered. Make sure the user has `read` access to this database. For the "Authenticate with mTLS option", you'll need to provide the following:

- **SSL client certificate**
- **SSL client key**

From here you, can proceed to [testing the connection](#test-the-connection) or click "show advanced settings" for more options.

### Advanced settings

Under Advanced settings, you have the option to enter the following:

- **SSL server name override**
- **SSL CA certificate chain**

### Test the connection

Once you have all of your connection information plugged in, click the "**Connect to database**" button. PlanetScale will attempt to connect to your database. If successful, you'll see a green checkmark with a success message. From here, you can click on the "**Begin database import**" button to import your data.

If the connection fails, you'll get an error message in the dashboard. Double check your connection information or see our [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) for more information.

### Import process

You'll see the table by table progress as the data is being imported.

Once your database has been imported, it's ready to [connect to your application](/tutorials/connect-any-application).
