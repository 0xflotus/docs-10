## Overview

PlanetScale provides an import tool in the dashboard that allows you to painlessly import an existing cloud-hosted MySQL database into your PlanetScale database.

## Import your database

To import an existing database into PlanetScale, first head to your PlanetScale dashboard and click on the "**Import**" button, which will bring you to the **Import Setup page**.

Type in the name for your PlanetScale database and select a region from the dropdown. Next, you'll fill out some connection information so that we can import your data.

### Set up the connection

Fill in the following values with information from your existing hosted database:

- **Host name**:
- **Port**:
- **Database name**:
- **Username**:

You'll have the option to **Authenticate with password** or **Authenticate with mTLS**.

To authenticate with password, simply type in your password. For the Authenticate with mTLS option, you'll need to provide the following:

- SSL client certificate: 
- SSL client key: 

### Advanced settings



### Test the connection

Once you have all of your connection information plugged in, click the "**Connect to database**" button. PlanetScale will attempt to connect to your database. If successful, you'll see a green checkmark with a success message. From here, you can click on the "**Begin database import**" button to import your data.

If the connection fails, you'll get an error message in the dashboard. Double check your connection information or see our [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) for more information.

### Import process

Once your database has been imported, it's ready to [connect to your application](/tutorials/connect-any-application).
