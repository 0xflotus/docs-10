# Understanding databases

This document explains the basic ideas behind databases in the PlanetScale database context.

## What is a PlanetScale database?

A PlanetScale database is like a MySQL database that can scale horizontally using [sharding](understanding-sharding-schemes). Each database runs on a [cluster](understanding-clusters).

You can assign resources to each database at the time of [database creation](creating-database). You can also choose to create replicas of particular databases to improve availability and serve more read traffic.
