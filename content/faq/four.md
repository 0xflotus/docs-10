order: 4
---

PlanetScale is committed to Vitess as an Open Source Project. PlanetScale CTO and Co-Founder, Sugu Sougoumarane, is the chief developer and community leader for Vitess. Many PlanetScale engineers contribute to the Vitess Project regularly.

We are committed to keeping the query serving path (based on Vitess and MySQL) open-source so that our customers will never have to fear vendor lock-in.

At PlanetScale, we are building a multi-cloud, Kubernetes powered database-as-a-service for Vitess. We offer our customers the tools and support they need to migrate into Vitess and move to the cloud.
