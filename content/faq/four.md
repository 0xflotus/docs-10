order: 4
---

PlanetScale’s mission is to help companies scale their relational data using Vitess, and its co-founders are the original creators of Vitess.

PlanetScale is committed to Vitess as an Open Source Project. Our CTO, Sugu, is the chief developer and community leader for Vitess and he will continue in this role. PlanetScale engineers do and will continue to contribute to the Vitess Project.

At PlanetScale, we are building the operational scaffolding that makes it easy to deploy and operate Vitess clusters at scale. We offer our customers the tools and support they need to build horizontally-scalable data systems on premise and in the cloud.

We are committed to keeping the query serving path (based on Vitess and MySQL) open-source so that our customers will never have to fear vendor lock-in.
