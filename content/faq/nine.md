question: How easy is it to use PlanetScale Cloud Database?
order: 9
---

If you are writing a new application, you can start using PlanetScale Cloud Database right away, as though you are writing to a MySQL database. If you want to migrate from an existing database, we can help through our professional services offering.

PlanetScale uses MySQL as the storage engine and provides MySQL protocol compatibility, so migration can happen quickly and easily without changes to your application.

While each NewSQL vendor has their own API, which makes migration difficult, migration into the PlanetScale platform from MySQL is easy. Your application code remains simple, unaware of sharding complexities, and you can still operate at scale.

If you are migrating from a key-value store or another relational database, you will need to make application changes to support MySQL protocol.
