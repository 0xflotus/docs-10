question: What is PlanetScale?
order: 1

PlanetScale is a company founded by the co-creators of Vitess in early 2018.

While working to help companies like Square, Slack, HubSpot and JD.com use Vitess to meet their scaling needs, we decided to build a company that would expand upon the work we had spent the past decade doing: a company that would build upon Vitess and that would help companies scale, scale and scale their data across clouds and across continents.
