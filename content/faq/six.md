Key-value stores allow you to scale your data horizontally by adding more nodes to your database. But, they lack in a number of other features, such as SQL protocol compatibility, secondary indexes, joins, and transactions.

PlanetScale CNDb allows you to scale your relational data like a NoSQL database; it scales horizontally like a key-value store, but without sacrificing relational features. The PlanetScale CNDb supports out-of-the-box globally scalable, multi-cloud deployments.
