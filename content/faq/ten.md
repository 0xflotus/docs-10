question: How is data stored in PlanetScale?

For PlanetScale DBaaS, PlanetScale uses MySQL Community Edition 5.7 with the InnoDB Engine as underlying storage for each shard.

If you are licensing the PlanetScale Cluster Manager Software, you can run it on top of MySQL (Communty/Enterprise/Percona), MariaDB, RDS on AWS, or CloudSQL on GCP.
