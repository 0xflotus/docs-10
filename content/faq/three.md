---

Vitess is an open source project born at Youtube and hosted by CNCF that runs very large OLTP workloads at companies such as GitHub, Slack and Square. YouTube used Vitess to run MySQL databases in Borg, the blueprint for Kubernetes, which makes it ideal for running MySQL databases at scale under Kubernetes. Companies like Hubspot and JD.com trust their production traffic to MySQL databases running under Vitess on Kubernetes. Vitess is a highly scalable cloud native database.
