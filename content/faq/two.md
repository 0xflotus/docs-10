question: What are the advantages of a relational database and a key-value database? How does PlanetScale compare?

Traditionally, key-value databases are heralded for for having greater scalability than relational databases. In cloud-based services and applications where data explodes exponentially with popularity (i.e. Facebook, LinkedIn), this scalability is essential.

However, what key-value stores have in scalability they lack in a number of other important features, including cross-vendor or SQL protocol compatibility, secondary indexes, joins, and real-time transactions.

PlanetScaleâ€™s novel offering, built on Vitess, uses a relational database with even greater scalability than key-value stores. At the same time, because of its relational backbone, PlanetScale does not sacrifice the key features that would normally be lost when working with a key-value store.

Essentially, PlanetScale allows you to scale your relational data like a NoSQL database. PlanetScale is a functional superset of a key-value store and also scales horizontally like a key-value store. The PlanetScale solution supports out-of-the-box globally scalable, multi-datacenter deployments.
