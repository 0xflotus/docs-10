We’re headed to Shanghai for [KubeCon China 2019](https://www.lfasiallc.com/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-china-2019/). We’re looking forward to spreading the word about Vitess and why it’s the best solution for stateful storage on Kubernetes.

- Interested in learning the basics about Vitess? Check out the [Intro to Vitess](https://sched.co/NrrW) session led by Jiten Vaidya and Toliver Jue on June 25th at 11:45.
- For those who want a deeper dive into Vitess, Jiten Vaidya will speak on [Exploring High Availability in Kubernetes with Vitess](https://sched.co/Nrq4) and demonstrate some of the most powerful features of Vitess on June 25th at 13:35.
- And we’re excited to kickoff translating Vitess documentation with this session led by Roni He and Toliver Jue [Translating Vitess: The Beginning](https://sched.co/Nrrc) on June 25th at 16:45. We’re looking forward to making Vitess more accessible to the developer community in China!
- JD.com, China’s largest online and offline retailer, will also be presenting on Vitess. Don’t miss their talk[ Two Years with Vitess: How JD.com Runs the World's Largest Vitess Deployment](https://sched.co/Nrpv) which will offer insight into JD.com’s experience using Vitess with Kubernetes.
