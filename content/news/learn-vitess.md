Vitess is a powerful database clustering middleware for MySQL. To learn Vitess, start with the [Vitess documentation](https://vitess.io/docs), and say hello to the community on [Slack](https://vitess.slack.com) (click [here](https://vitess.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzIxMDMyMzA0NzA1LTBjYjY1M2I2Yjg5YmY3ODIwOTk0N2M1YzI4Y2ViODdiNmIxMDdiMDM5YWQ1ZTc0YmJhZDdiOTliMGVkNDY4MjM) if you need an invite).

As you make your way through the documentation, here are some other resources that can help you get off the ground.

* **[Vitess: Scaling MySQL with Sugu Sougoumarane](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/05/15/vitess-scaling-mysql-with-sugu-sougoumarane/)**: Find out more about what happens when a query is parsed by Vitess. 
* **[PlanetScale: Sharded Database Management with Jiten Vaidya and Dan Kozlowski](softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/02/21/planetscale-sharded-database-management-with-jiten-vaidya-and-dan-kozlowski/)**: a podcast with Software Engineering Daily discussing scaling relational databases with Vitess, and the type of engineering debt you incur if you scale in-app instead of with a tool like Vitess
* **[Q&A With Jiten Vaidya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2m2nQeIlA0)**: Why Companies like YouTube, Slack and JD.com Use Vitess
* **[Sharding Cash](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/sharding-cash-10280fa3ef3b)**: Square's engineering team at Cash App wrote a fantastic series on using Vitess to shard Cash

Happy sharding!
