We're headed to Oracle Open World next week and then to Percona Live in Amsterdam at the end of September. We’re looking forward to showcasing how Vitess can be used to manage stateful workloads on Kubernetes.

## Oracle Open World

They'll discuss Slack's approach to database architecture, including how they've leveraged Vitess to scale. Vitess currently handles nearly half of Slack’s database traffic.
