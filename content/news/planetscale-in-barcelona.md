[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Barcelona](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2019/), we just have to be there! PlanetScale was not only founded by the co-founders and maintainers of the open source project Vitess, Vitess is also an incubating project in CNCF.

The PlanetScale team will be at KubeCon + CloudNative Con in full force!

* We kick off with [KubeHunt](http://bit.ly/kubehunt-2019-planetscale) (sign up now!), a treasure hunt co-hosted with Red Hat, Turbonomic, and other great companies. We will conclude the evening with "Smooth Operator", a special event at [Ocana](https://goo.gl/maps/rhaU49iD86qK5LnL7) to hear about how and why PlanetScale built a certified operator   
* Jiten will have some great news to share! He’ll be meeting with users, partners, press, analysts, and basically anyone who wants to talk about PlanetScale.
* All day Monday, we’ll be at the [Kubernetes Operator Frameworks Workshop](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2019/co-located-events/). There’s a little bit of Vitess to talk about there! The workshop is at capacity, but there is a waitlist and the doors open at 3pm to talk Operators. **Monday 05/20/19 9:00-17:00, Fira Gran Via Hall 8.0 Room D2.**
* Sugu and Deepthi are doing an [Intro to Vitess](https://sched.co/MPiq), covering the features and a tutorial (!) on bringing up a Vitess cluster in Kubernetes. They will then go through the steps to reshard the database while it’s serving live traffic. **Wednesday 05/15/19 11:05, Hall 8.0 E1.**
* Jiten and Dan will take the scary out of storing data in the cloud with [Vitess Deep Dive](https://sched.co/MPkL), including configuring a resilient Vitess server and how it survives various events like pod evictions and node restarts. **Thursday 05/16/19 14:50, CC7.**

And oh yea, we’ll have a booth. We are hanging out in the start-up section, booth SE28. We’ll be showing a live demo of Vitess. Watch the sharding in action!

Want to [set up a meeting](http://calendly.com/planetscale) with the PlanetScale team to talk all things Vitess? We LOVE meeting with the community!

For stateful workload for Kubernetes, it’s Vitess and PlanetScale! See you in Barcelona.
