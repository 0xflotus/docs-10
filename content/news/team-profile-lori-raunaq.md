### Interviewer: Abhi Vaidyanatha, PlanetScale Software Engineer

### Interviewee: Lori Clerkin, PlanetScale Executive Assistant
### Interviewee: Raunaq Gupta, PlanetScale UI/UX Designer

_Here at PlanetScale, we have an extremely diverse group of individuals that make up our team. Considering how different our backgrounds are, I thought it would be worthwile to give everyone a peek into the awesome things that make us who we are. As a side note, it may sound like I made up the flow of this interview for comedic effect, but it was just as scatter-brained as it sounds. We made coffee right before this interview, which could explain a few things.

**Abhi: Hey guys how's it going?**

Lori: Bitchin' dude.
Raunaq: I love this coffee so much.
L: Right, it's really good!
R: I need more of it... as long as I don't die eating something, I'll eat it.
L: Did you ever eat the worm of a tequila?
R: Is that a thing?
L: Yeah you drink it and you're drunk for like 3 or 4 days because the worm is living inside of you.
R: Can't say I've tried that. I do want to eat locusts though. There's a restaurant in the city that serves them.

**Abhi: So Lori... What would you say are your main hobbies or interests?**

L: First off, I'm not complex. What you see is what you get.
R: Like the wysiwyg editor?
L: What?...
R: What you see is what you get.
L: *Visible confusion*
L: Anyway, I don't like to say that certain things define me, but if I had to pick it would be triathlon and music. I grew up with older siblings that introduced me to 60s, 70s, and 80s music. Stuff like Rush, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne, and Black Sabbath. My sister used to lay in the basement with speakers next to her ears and listen to Black Sabbath, so I think it's in my blood. Although, I really only started listening to harder stuff after going to OzFest.
R: One of my favorite bands, Incubus, opened for Ozzy at OzFest once. Maybe they exchange melodies. Is there a GitHub for melodies?
L: *Completely ignores Raunaq's comment*
L: When Lady Gaga and Metallica performed at the Super Bowl I stopped listening to Metallica for a while.
R: Wasn't Metallica the first band to sue Napster? I read that in a book somewhere.
L: Lars is a jerk. He is.
R: I don't know him personally, I'm sure he is a nice man. I think you need energy to be an asshole.
L: I think you need energy to be a drummer. He's not that great. The rest of Metallica is insane, Lars is lucky to be where he is. Eh... I'm totally doggin' poor Lars. He's gonna come after me.
R: Oh man, yeah.

**Abhi: Okay, how about you Raunaq?**

R: These days I really like cats and cars. I'm always looking to photograph new cats and old cars. I think about design a lot too; I can't separate myself from that. I love going to concerts...
L: ...And you travel for them too!
R: ...And I traveled extensively for them. These days I really like Nine Inch Nails. They’ve sorta mellowed down but they are still making really good music. They don’t want to get bored or make the audience bored of doing the same thing over and over again, which I feel like is really important.
L: Very similar to Godsmack, who are also maturing with their music while their music matures with them. 
R: I do have one small hobby - I collect small die-cast toy cars.
L: SEE, you're way more interesting than I am.
R: *Ignoring Lori's comment*
R: I feel like cars are such an amazing design constraint - you can do so much with the aesthetic of a car, it's beautiful. America has such a cool modding culture around cars.

**Abhi: So you like new cats and old dogs... I mean old cars.**

R: New cats and old dogs sounds like a really good band name. "We are new cats and old dogs... live from Mountain View Amphitheatre!"
L: *Guitar noises*
R: I actually saw Incubus in Kuala Lumpur in 2011, and again in 2015... then again this year in India. That was the first time they visited India actually.
L: That is awesome, they knew, they felt the vibe. I'm trying to think of when I saw them. I think it was in '98 at Slims in SF. It's owned by Boz Scaggs, famous for that one song... you know the one that goes, "Lido... whoah oh oh."

**Abhi: I think you need a degree in paleontology to know that song.**

L: Whatever, it doesn't bother me at all. I could care less how old i am. *Raspberry noises*
R: I'm also gonna see Ben Kenny, who is playing with Incubus right now. He previously played for the Roots. 
L: They are a bunch of rich kids, like Peter Gabriel.
R: Who is that guy?
L: *Blank, aghast stare*

**Abhi: C'mon Raunaq, even I know who that is.**

L: Yeah, because of your dad.

**Abhi: Nuh uh.**

L: Okay, it's because you're a DJ.

**Abhi: Am I not allowed to have good taste in music?**

L: *Looks over to Raunaq*
L: He sung with Genesis. I actually just saw Phil Collins and he had to sit in a chair because he fell ill.
R: So he was Fell Collins?
L: *Laughing a little too hard at Raunaq's bad joke*
L: He had drop foot!
R: Drop foot sounds like a band name. I wish this room were full of cats right now. I keep thinking about being in a room suffocating with cats. 

*Lori's dog, Rocco, enters the room*

![Rocco](/img/201812-blog-rocco.jpg)

L: How about a big greyhound instead of cats?
R: *Talks for a while about Lori's sheep socks and a riddle he heard on a cab ride*
L: I still don't get that riddle. The one about the goat, farmer, cabbage, and wolf. 
R: I'm surprised there isn't an Uber like rideshare app called Cabbage. Because it's cabs. And everything is about the cab economy - Cabbage - it's the age of the cabs.
L: Cabbage patch dolls ruined this word for everyone.
R: I don't know this culture. 
L: Show him a picture of the doll. Do you know Chucky?
R: Like Chuck E Cheese?
L: *Laughing, a little out of breath*
R: I do know about Sour Patch Kids.
L: Yes, those are amazing. But yes, Chucky is a doll that comes to life and kills people.
R: Just for fun?
L: Yeah.
R: Ah interesting. I heard that Sour Patch Kids got their name to cash in on the marketing from Cabbage Patch Kids. There's a video game about it too. You're a Sour Patch Kid that needs to be eaten.
L: What?
R: I just read the Wikipedia page ok?
L: I just picture this Sour Patch Kid trying to walk around New York trying to jump in peoples' mouths.
R: *Pauses to think for a little bit*
R: You know Kumail Nanjiani? Someone said that they saw him at the Incubus concert. And he was! He actually acts in this show called Portlandia, which is really funny. My friends seem to think it's super dumb.
L: Mindless entertainment is where it's at.
R: Okay, on to the next question.

**Abhi: Alright, so wh-**

L: What's my favorite band? It's Godsmack. It's on my license plate too.
R: Is that allowed?
L: I mean you can have TJ heart MC.
R: What is that, Trader Joes loves Michael Caine?
L: *Actually starting to get out of breath from laughing*
R: *Raunaq tries to whisper to Abhi to ask the next question*
R: Do you have a list of questions or are you just making shit up? Were we talking about Gwyneth Paltrow at some point?
L: No, Lady Gaga. 
R: Someone was telling me about Gwyneth Paltrow at some point. She runs a store called Goop now.
L: Hair products?
R: All kinds of products.
L: I think that was just in your dreams.
R: That would be awful. Like a nightmare. I need some order in this interview... it's too free form, I feel like I'm wasting peoples' time.
L: I'm the one that was shitting on Lars.
R: I mean... he doesn't care.
L: Yeah, he's probably like "Free publicity!" Ok next question.

*Abhi doesn't even try to get a word in this time*

R: I have a cat too, back home, who I'm missing these days. I have a person fostering him right now and she says that she loves him and I'm scared that she's gonna take the cat from me.
L: Oh no!
R: Yeah I gotta get back soon.
L: I'm crying, it's exhausting to laugh.

**Abhi: Okay. Let's get to another question. What's something that you guys are looking forward to in the upcoming holidays?**

L: I’m looking forward to my birthday in 5 days.
R: Oh sweet! My birthday is on the 20th! 
R: *Hi-fives Lori*
L: Eeeek! Look at that. 
R: That’s why I’m gonna see Ben Kenney! It’s his last solo show.
L: I’m so jealous, you have to go. I’m looking forward to the company taking off, the Godsmack show in April in Milwaukee, and going to the beach in June.

**Abhi: What about you Raunaq?**

R: I’m probably gonna see Thom Yorke, the lead singer of Radiohead.
L: I can’t stand his voice. Euuuugh. The second he opens his mouth I’m like aaaaah. I’m sorry.
R: That’s understandable. You don’t have to apologize for opinions. I’m gonna go meet my friend Jason in Chicago... 
L: ...Deep dish pizza.
R: ...Yeah, and these sandwiches that are made out of plantain buns.
L: I’m gonna eat my way through Chicago when I go...
R: ...Like Pac-Man.
L: Yeah exactly, I’m gonna do that in Milwaukee. Gonna squeeze in some extra meals.
R: Yeah I guess that’s pretty much it for the holidays.
L: And the future?
R: Yeah, the future is very uncertain.
L: Do you love your birthday too. It’s your day!
R: Do I?
L: You get to wake up and say “I can do whatever the f\*\*\* I want”
R: But I say that to myself every day! 
L: *Goes into another bout of laughter*
R: I’m alive... not dead. Isn’t that a Pearl Jam song??
L: *Starts singing the song* 
L: Can I just say that Eddie Vedder is super hot. 
R: He plays the uke pretty nicely too.
L: I saw Pearl Jam open for the Rolling Stones. Just as they were in the middle of their set it was pouring rain and man... there’s nothing hotter than Eddie Vedder in the rain. It was pretty spectacular.
R: Yeah that’s burned into my memory now. 
L: I love that he’s good friends with Neil Young who's also really cool... well super cool until he cheated on his wife.
R: What’s your most memorable concert experience?
L: Grateful Dead for sure. We get there and we couldn’t find parking. So I gave my keys to a random guy and told him to just come back and get us at 11 AND HE DID.
R: That’s ballsy. That’s wow. Wow.
L: Yeah there were a lot of things wrong with that night.
R: No that’s fine... that’s fine... But just giving your car to someone?
L: We did drop him off at his house. That was the most memorable show ever - there was nothing like it. Everyone just loves everyone else and loves the music; strangers are best friends by the end of the concert. Sorry Godsmack. You're not my most memorable show but I love you.

**A: Well… thanks guys! I feel like I just need to get you guys a show and have you talk to each other.**

R: It would definitely have to be a podcast. What would we call the podcast?
L: Brown and White.
R&L: *Laughing way too hard*

*Abhi actually only got to 2 out of the 8 questions he had for the interview.*
