### Vitess Webinar

For those of you farther afield, our CTO Sugu Sougumarane will speak on “Vitess: Running Sharded MySQL on Kubernetes” as a part of the CNCF Webinar Series at 10am PT on July 16th. RSVP here to learn more about Vitess’s high level features with a focus on what makes Vitess cloud-native. Sugu will conclude with a demo of the powerful materialized views feature that most other sharded systems have yet to solve.
