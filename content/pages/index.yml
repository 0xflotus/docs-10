        Vitess automatically rewrites queries that hurt database performance. It also uses caching mechanisms to mediate queries and prevent duplicate queries from simultaneously reaching your database.

        Vitess handles functions like master failovers and backups. It uses a lock server to track and administer servers, letting your application be blissfully ignorant of database topology.

        MySQL doesn’t natively support sharding, but you will likely need it as your database grows. Vitess saves you from having to add sharding logic to your app and also enables live resharding with minimal read-only downtime.
