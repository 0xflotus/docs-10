title: Privacy Policy
content: |
  PlanetScale, Inc. (“PlanetScale”) appreciates you using our products and services. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we collect, use, and handle your personally identifying information (or “PII”) when you use our websites (“Websites”), and our software and services (“Services”) as follows.

  Website Visitors and Service Users

  Like many managed service operators, we collect non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, device type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request, and we store it in log files. Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.

  We may also collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our Websites and our Services, as well as potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. Our purpose in collecting such information is to better understand how our visitors use the Websites and Services, and to improve the Websites and Services. We do not disclose such statistics and IP address information other than under the circumstances described further below.

  Your Account with Our Services

  PlanetScale collects information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address when you set up your account with our Services.


  Your Data with Our Services

  When you use PlanetScale Services, we store, process, and transmit your files (including data, photos, documents, and emails) and information related to them. This will make it easy for you to do things like share your information, send emails, and invite others to use the Services.

  Cookies and other technologies

  We and our partners (including analytics providers) use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Websites and our Services, and this may include using cookies, beacons, tags, or similar technologies to identify your browser or device, and to analyze trends, track users’ movements around the website and the service, and to gather information about our visitors and users.

  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of our Websites and Services, and their preferences. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computers, you should set your browsers to refuse cookies before using our services, with the drawback that certain or all of the features of our services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

  Behavioral Targeting/Retargeting

  We may partner with one or more third-party ad networks to either display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifying information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to learn more about your advertising choices and how to opt out of behavioral targeting and interest-based advertising, click here (https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or if located in the European Union, click here (https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

  Customer and User Quotes and Testimonials

  We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers and users on our Websites in addition to other endorsements. With your consent we may post your personal testimonial with your name and/or with your bio picture. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at info@planetscale.com.

  Usage

  We may share information as outlined below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or other third-parties.

  PlanetScale Employees and Contractors

  PlanetScale uses third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Websites and our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. Your account administrator and PlanetScale support personnel may have the ability to access and control your PlanetScale account.

  Third Party Applications

  You can also choose to give third parties access to your information and your account for the Services—for example, via PlanetScale APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.

  Bulletin Boards / Chat Rooms

  If you use a bulletin board or chat room associated with the Websites or the Services, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums and others who have access to the archive, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

  Law Enforcement

  We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of PlanetScale or our users; or (d) protect PlanetScale’s property rights.

  Our users’ data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it’s stored on our services or on their home computer’s hard drive, therefore we abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests for our users’ data:

  Be transparent,
  Fight blanket requests,
  Protect all users, and
  Provide trusted services.

  Security

  For our Services, we have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure, and we take precautions to ensure the security of your PII. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the PII submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication and encryption of backup files.

  That said, like any managed service provider, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your PII despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Websites and the Services, your information will travel through third-party infrastructures which are not under our control.

  Retention of Information

  For users of our Services, we will retain information and PII you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services.

  If you delete your account with our Services, we’ll also delete this information. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage; and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements; and (3) where our customer for the Services is an organization and you are accessing and using the Service as an authorized representative of that organization, references to “you” and the like in this Privacy Policy generally refer to the customer organization, not individual end users. In such cases, we receive and process information under the direction of our customer. If you as an individual seek to delete an account or to delete inaccurate data, you should direct your query to the applicable customer organization, and we will respond to the customer’s request within a reasonable timeframe.

  International

  To provide you with the Websites and Services, we may store, process, and transmit information in the United States and locations around the world, including locations outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices you use to access the Websites and Services.

  Opt-Out Policy

  If, at any time after providing us with your PII, you change your mind about receiving information from us or about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request at info@planetscale.com specifying your new choice. You may also choose to stop receiving our technical newsletter, product updates, marketing emails, and invitations by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails.

  Changes

  Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without notifying you. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
