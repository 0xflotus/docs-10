Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand how we treat your information.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your access to, use of and/or participation in connection with the Service or any other particular service, feature, function, initiative, promotion or activity offered on or through the Service terminates, expires, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in, access and/or use the Website, the PlanetScale  Cloud Database service  or any other portion of the Service.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy governs only the information collected by us on or through your use of the Service, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other third party, unless specifically stated.</p>

  <h3 id="2informationwecollectaboutyou">2. Information We Collect About You</h3>

  <p>Information you Provide Voluntarily. We collect the information you voluntarily provide to us. For example:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>In order to access and/or use the Service (e.g., account registration, billing, etc.), we may require that you provide and/or otherwise make available to us certain information, which may include, among other things, your legal name, email address, company affiliation, physical address and telephone number .</li>

  <li>If you purchase products or services, then we or our third party payment processor will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address.</li>

  <li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply. When you post messages to the Website or otherwise communicate with us or other users via the Service, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users may be able to see it.</li>

  <li>We also collect other types of Personal Information that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, and other requested information if you contact us via email regarding support for the Service.</li>

  <li>We may allow you to sign up and log in to the Service using accounts you create with third-party products and services, such as Google and Github (collectively, "Third-Party Accounts"). If you access the Service with Third-Party Accounts we will collect information that you have agreed to make available such as your name, email address, profile information and preferences with the applicable Third-Party Account. This information is collected by the Third-Party Account provider and is provided to us under their privacy policies. You can generally control the information that we receive from these sources using the privacy settings in your Third-Party Account.</li>

  <li>When you participate in one of our surveys, we will collect the information you choose to submit to us.</li>

  <li>We may also collect Personal Information at other points in the Service that state that Personal Information is being collected.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically.</strong>  When you access and/or use the Service, we automatically collect certain information through  cookies, web beacons and other technologies and store it in our log files. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, operating system and version, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, device type, language preference, referring / exit pages and URLs, pages you view on our Website, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Website, search terms you entered to arrive at our Website, the date and time of each of your requests and other such information regarding your access to and/or use of the Service . We may combine this information with other information that we have collected about you, including, where applicable, your username, name, and other Personal Information. Please see the section "Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms" below for more information.</p>

  <p><strong>Location data.</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p>

  <p><strong>Invitations.</strong> If you use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service we may ask you for that person's name, user ID, email address or other contact information and automatically send an invitation to the invitee. We store this information to send this invitation and to track the success of our invitation service. Unless the invitee becomes a user of the Service, we do not use the invitee's contact information for marketing purposes, and we do not share the invitee's contact information with third parties other than PlanetScale's service providers in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The invitee may contact us at contact @planetscale.com  at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database. If you submit any personal information about other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to allow us to use their Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy (for example, by asking for their consent).</p>

  <p><strong>Information we obtain from other third party sources.</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties, but only where we have received assurances from these third parties that they have either received your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your Personal Information to us. For example, the customer relationship management software we use may supplement your contact information we have entered for you with information available from third party sources (e.g., LinkedIn).  This information could include, but is not limited to any information that you have permitted the a third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.</p>

  <h3 id="4sharinganddisclosureofpersonalinformationandotherinformation">4. Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information and Other Information</h3>

  <p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may share your information with third-party business partners, consultants and service providers that perform services on our behalf for the purpose of providing the Service to you (e.g., email providers, hosting providers, analytics companies, etc.). Those business partners will be given limited access to your information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the Service. We use third party payment processors to collect and store your payment card information and to process payments in connection with the Service. Any information that you provide to our payment processors is governed by each processor's separate privacy policy instead of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties. PlanetScale  neither collects nor stores your payment card information on its servers. Except as stated in this privacy policy or unless we inform you otherwise, our service providers do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what we deem necessary to assist us in performing such tasks.</p>

  <p><strong>Customer and User Quotes and Testimonials.</strong> We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers and users on our Website in addition to other endorsements.

  <p><strong>Your Third Party Services.</strong> You can also choose to give third parties access to your information and your account for the Service—for example, via PlanetScale APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.</p>

  <p><strong>Additional Disclosures.</strong> PlanetScale will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or governmental entity; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, and personal safety of PlanetScale , our employees, other users of the Service and others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

  <p>Our users' data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home computer's hard drive, therefore we abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing, and responding to government requests for our users' data:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Be transparent,</li>

  <li>Fight blanket requests,</li>

  <li>Protect all users, and</li>

  <li>Provide trusted services.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Corporate Restructuring.</strong> We may buy or sell, divest or transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as customer names and email addresses, and other user information related to the Service (as described herein) will likely be among the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell, transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, liquidations or similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.</p>

  <p><strong>Aggregate and/or Non-identified Information.</strong> We may also share information with others in an aggregated and anonymous form that does not reasonably identify you directly as an individual for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and our disclosure of such information is not subject to restriction.</p>

  <p><strong>Others.</strong>  We may disclose your Personal Information to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</p>

  <p><strong>Withdraw consent.</strong> If we have collected and processed your Personal Information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

  <h3 id="6ouruseofcookiesandothertrackingmechanisms">6. Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>

  <p>We and our third party service providers (including analytics providers) may use "cookies" (which are small electronic files containing information about you and your activities that are stored on your Device (e.g., html files, Flash files, etc.), "embedded scripts", web beacons and other similar tracking technologies to collect and store information automatically as you use, access and/or otherwise interact with the Website and the Service.  We may combine this information with other Personal Information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).</p>

  <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Service, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process, to allow us to track your activities on our Service, or to otherwise enable Service features. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Website who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Website, but some features may not function.</p>

  <p><strong>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content and compile statistics about Website usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

  <p><strong>LSOs.</strong> We or third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features of the Service or to display advertising based upon your tracked activity may use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) using technologies such as HTML5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To learn about managing Flash LSOs, please click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969142000">here</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Third-party Analytics.</strong> We use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze collected information in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Service to our visitors' needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969142000">privacy policy</a> addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.</p>

  <p>Please be aware that that if you limit the collection of certain information, you may not be able to use some or all of the Service.</p>

  <h3 id="7interestbasedadvertising">7. Interest Based Advertising.</h3>

  <p>The Service may also use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, <strong>"Third Party Advertising Service Providers"</strong>), such as Google Adwords and Facebook. We use Third Party Advertising Service Providers to, for example, serve advertisements on or in connection with the Service, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on or in connection with the Service and any use thereof. Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your profile and corresponding use of the Service and other websites, services and platforms you have used or visited. Targeting services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.</p>

  <p>Third Party Advertising Service Providers may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you . These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including Personal Information, about you.</p>

  <p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/choices/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969143000">Consumer Choice Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising  and choices regarding having information used by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/participating&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969144000">DAA companies</a>. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969144000">Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by NAI members.</p>

  <p>Users in the European Union may also opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance ("EDAA") <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://youronlinechoices.eu/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969145000">Your Online Choices Page</a>for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and choices regarding having information used by <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969145000">EDAA members</a>.</p>

  <p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/choices/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969145000">Consumer Choice Page</a>, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969146000">NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> or the EDAA <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://youronlinechoices.eu/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969146000">Your Online Choices Page</a> will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Website or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI, or EDAA-related websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA's website at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.aboutads.info/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969146000">www.aboutads.info</a>, the NAI's website at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.networkadvertising.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969147000">www.networkadvertising.org</a>, and the EDAA's website at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556584969147000">www.youronlinechoices.com/goodpractice</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="8minors">8. Minors</h3>

  <p>The Service is not directed toward children under 16 years of age, and PlanetScale  does not want to collect and does not seek to collect Personal Information from children under 16 or knowingly allow such persons to become a registered user of the Service.  If we discover that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 16, we will take steps to remove that information from our systems.  If you believe the Company inadvertently collected information from a child under 16 years of age, please contact contact@planetscale.com .</p>

  <h3 id="9yourcaliforniaprivacyrightscaliforniadonottrackdisclosure">9. Your California Privacy Rights &amp; California Do Not Track Disclosure</h3>

  <p>If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options with respect to use of your Personal Information by third parties for marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third-party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to our Privacy Administrator at contact@planetscale.com  detailing your privacy request.

We will not accept requests via the telephone, postal mail or by fax. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete or legible information.</p>

  <p><em>Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests.</em> You may, however, disable certain tracking (e.g., by disabling cookies) as discussed above in the section "Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms".

  <h3 id="10transferofpersonalinformationtotheunitedstates">10. Transfer of Personal Information to the United States</h3>

  <p>If you visit, access, interact with and/or otherwise use the Service from a location outside the United States, please be advised that any information you provide in connection with any such activity may be processed in and/or transferred to the United States of America and/or other territories and locations around the world, where privacy protections may not be as comprehensive as those in the territory or location where you interact with or otherwise use the Service. We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These include implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of Personal Information with our third party service providers and partners or ensuring that such service providers and partners are certified with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, and further details can be provided upon request.  By using the Services, you affirmatively consent to the transfer, use, disclosure, provision, and other administration of your information as described herein.</p>

  <h3 id="11legalbasisforouruseeeavisitorsonly">11. Legal Basis For Our Use (EEA visitors only)</h3>

  <p>If you are a resident from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.  However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you.</p>

  <p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information).  Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

  <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information for any specific processing activity, please contact us by sending an email to us at contact@planetscale.com .</p>

  <h3 id="12security">12. Security</h3>

  <p>We have a team dedicated to keeping your Personal Information secure.  We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, and have implemented appropriate physical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction such as storing such information using third party data centers that are routinely and independently audited against widely accepted security standards, encrypting data at rest and in transit and providing security training to our employees.That said, like any managed service provider, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties or unauthorized personnel will not gain access to your Personal Information despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Website and the Service, your information will travel through third-party infrastructures which are not under our control. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your login and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

  <h3 id="13dataretention">13. Data Retention</h3>

  <p>We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

  <p>If you delete your account with our Service, we'll also delete this information. But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and backup storage; (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements; and (3) where our customer of the Service is an organization and you are accessing and using the Service as an authorized representative of that organization, references to "you" and the like in this Privacy Policy generally refer to the customer organization, not individual end users. In such cases, we receive and process information under the direction of our customer.
