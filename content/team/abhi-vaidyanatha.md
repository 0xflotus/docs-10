Abhi is a confused economist who enjoys writing backend code for various parts of PlanetScale's Vitess management software. Previously working for Lockheed Martin and the Department of Economics at UCSB, he holds theoretical and applied experience in data science, machine learning, and academic research. In his spare time he is a DJ, [podcast](https://beyondthemetagame.transistor.fm) host, and competitive Super Smash Bros. player. He particularly enjoys barrel-aged beer, good pour-overs, and unnecessarily spicy food. He is a staunch advocate of proper semicolon usage, Oxford commas and overused grammar jokes.
