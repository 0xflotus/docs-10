Anthony joined the Vitess team in 2014 and quickly made it his mission to help Vitess "escape" from YouTube by supporting external users and contributors with docs, scripts, tutorials, blog posts, a release process, and features that eliminated dependencies on Google-internal infrastructure. He also maintained the Vitess control plane components, going on call and working with YouTube SREs to improve operability, reliability, and scalability.

In 2016, he transferred to the Kubernetes team at Google, where he helped develop core features and extensions to better support deployment and automation of distributed, stateful workloads. He helped Vitess clear the CNCF due diligence process by showcasing its cloud-native nature and Kubernetes integration through live demos, and became a founding member of the Vitess Project Management Committee. In addition, Anthony is widely credited as the person who finally settled the great "kubectl" pronunciation debate [once and for all](https://twitter.com/enisoc/status/1112422388073824256).
