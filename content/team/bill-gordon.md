Bill (usually called Gordon) focuses on front-end development at Planetscale and works at home out of Delaware. He previously worked for a mid-size company leading a team to building a robustly featured custom reporting framework. He enjoys video games, traveling the world, his cats, and cooking. After getting a sous vide machine a few years back he is always looking for the next thing to sous vide. In addition to his hobbies and work, he will be (trying) to help his fiance prepare for their wedding in the fall of 2020.
