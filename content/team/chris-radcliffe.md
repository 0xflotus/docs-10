Chris focuses on delivery of PlanetScale's offerings to new customers, and their continued success.

He is an experienced software developer and tech leader, and is thrilled to return to his hands-on software engineering roots with PlanetScale and Vitess technology. Much of his career has been with startups and early stage companies, helping them get to the next level, and beyond.

He began his journey with relational databases and SQL on UNIX in the mid-1980's with pioneer Informix Software. He later joined NeXT Computer led by Steve Jobs, and contributed to an amazing early tech culture. The internet/web explosion propelled him into digital rights management (InterTrust), massive content streaming infrastructure (iBeam), and finally ebrary, the ebook market leader for academic publishing (acquired by giant ProQuest).

Chris is a lifelong surfer, regularly in the lineup at Santa Cruz and Ocean Beach, SF. He looks forward to getting his granddaughters out there with him. He will happily discuss either topic!
