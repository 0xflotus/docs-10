He is also the creator of the multi-award winning smoked chili and grandmaster emeritus of the most prestigious chili competition on the east coast of the US. Dan is an accomplished gardener with a thorough understanding of fruit trees. His specialty is apple trees, however with his relocation to Silicon Valley, citrus trees are now his passion. Bike riding is a favorite pastime of Dan's and he has a goal to ride to Alice's up Rt 9. Dan served as a technologist in two presidential administrations, helped with technology modernization for both large and small companies, wrote software to control aircraft carriers, and has been an early stage engineer at a startup. He is intimately familiar with the internals of the linux kernel and the MySQL codebase, but is still looking for the first patch to submit upstream.
