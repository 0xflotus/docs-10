Originally from NJ, Gary recently moved to the bay area after spending a year in Seattle. Prior to joining PlanetScale, he worked at tech startup based in Delaware on the Platform Engineering team before transitioning to Professional Services. After working on-site at multiple Fortune 500 companies, he decided it was time to head back to a true startup. Gary is passionate about cars, coding and computers, and golf, not necessarily in any order.
