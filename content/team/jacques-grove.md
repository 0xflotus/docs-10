Jacques joins us from Google Cloud Professional Services, where he was the Global Lead for Infrastructure. Prior to that, he ran operations at Clover Point-of-Sale and TripIt, and also wrote the email parsing infrastructure at TripIt. In the earlier days of the Internet, Jacques worked at Sun, Loudcloud and Opsware. You can always find Jacques in the office by following the sound of his Model M keyboard, one of his collection of vintage keyboards and computers, which he enjoys restoring in his free time.
