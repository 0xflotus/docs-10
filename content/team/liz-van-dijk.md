Some errant light fixtures ever so slightly illuminated the forlorn streets of Marrakesh... the atmosphere of every western spy movie ever. Sensitive Information was abound in the streets; someone needed to intercept, relay, and secure it. This is where Liz earned her keep. Working as a spy for multiple world organizations, she managed to infiltrate nearly every single intelligence agency within a matter of weeks. Through her exploits, she holds many unique titles, one of which is being the only individual to teach Gordon Ramsey a better way to filet hand-caught Alaskan salmon. Her trademarked attitude and no-nonsense demeanor have carried her to great heights, and now finally PlanetScale. While negotiating the complex social structure of European trade, she picked up a natural tact at solving problems for a myriad of different situations. In totality, she brings her trademarked attitude, drive, and sharp wit to the already stacked roster of PlanetScale employees.
