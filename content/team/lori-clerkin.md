Lori has been an early employee at companies such as CATS Software, Yelp, and Slide, which was acquired by Google. Lori then spent over seven years at YouTube and Google, working with the Video infrastructure, Infrastructure and Site Reliability Teams. Lori actively trains for marathons/triathlons, and loves spending time with her pets Rocco (a retired racer greyhound), and Coco and Sawyer, her two rescued cats. When not training or watching the Bachelor, she is reading about her favorite artists or planning to see them live.
