Lori has been an early employee at companies such as CATS Software, Yelp, and Slide, which was acquired by Google. Lori then spent over seven years at YouTube and Google, working with the Video infrastructure, Infrastructure and Site Reliability Teams. When not working, Lori trains for triathlons, and snuggles with her pets Rocco (a rescued and retired racer greyhound), and Coco and Sawyer, her two rescued cats.
