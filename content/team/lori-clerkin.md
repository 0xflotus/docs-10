Lori Clerkin thrives on working with teams at early stage companies. She will do anything and everything to contribute to building strong foundations and a culture that makes coming to work fun and productive. Lori has been an early employee at companies such as CATS Software, Yelp, and Slide, which was acquired by Google. Lori then spent over seven years at YouTube and Google, working with the Video infrastructure, Infrastructure and Site Reliability Teams. She could not be happier now that she is back in her element. When not working, Lori trains for triathlons, and snuggles with her pets Rocco (a rescued and retired racer greyhound), and Coco and Sawyer, her two rescued cats.
