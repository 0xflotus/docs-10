Lucy joins the product team at PlanetScale where she shares her enthusiasm for capturing customer needs and translating them into easy-to-use products. When she’s not thinking about product management, she writes poetry (find her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lucykburns)), plans international adventures, and tries to spend as much time outdoors as possible. She enjoys cooking vegetarian food from the surprise vegetables in her CSA, drinking too much coffee, riding her bike, and when she can’t be outside, she spends her time reading—ask her about her favorite books.
