Peter is a living legend of sorts. He descends from a borough in Estonia called Peetri, the supposed origin of all Peters. He has 52 drinks named after him in 45 establishments. He owns a few islands near Mauritius. He sailed around the world with Elon Musk and Levar Burton. He spent an inordinate amount of time terraforming parts of Brazil, being the sole reason that the Amazon even exists today (albeit hanging by a thread). Through his extensive knowledge quelling geopolitical uprisings and mapping unknown parts of the world, he couldn't stave off the allure of the Silicon Valley. With his background on various planetary issues, he fit in well with the team at PlanetScale. You can find him in his free time (and happy hour) excessively sharing new stories about his worldly romps.
