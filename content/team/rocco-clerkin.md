Rocco, one of the earliest employees at PlanetScale, earns his keep as the beloved office mascot. He decided to leave his home of Florida after realizing that the racing life wasn't for him and is considered one of the pivotal contributers to ending dog racing in the state. When not sleeping in the middle of the office, he enjoys the simple pleasures of life such as long walks on the beach, tender meat, and pets. He treasures his friendship with the Minister of Engineering and seemingly loves his food delivery agent, Lori.
