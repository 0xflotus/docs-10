In order for Saif to be allowed to try a new restaurant with the co-worker behind this website, he was required to write a lengthy bio that went beyond four words. This is that bio. Saif started programming when he was 7 years old because of a badly planned prank by his older brother, who taught him C++ as a joke. Saif actually fell in love with programming and now does that for a living. During his undergrad years he worked on Bioinformatics and found his love for research. Previously, he worked at a research center where he co-authored five papers that were accepted to various top conferences, lived in cold Minnesota for graduate school, worked on writing spatial algorithms in southern California, and finally landed in the Bay Area with PlanetScale. Now, he will get to find out if that restaurant is any good.
