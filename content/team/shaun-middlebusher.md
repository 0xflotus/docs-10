Shaun is primarily focused on defining and building the PlanetScale brand. While he's had the privilege of scaling with companies to the global level, he particularly enjoys tackling the challenges found in early stage startups. You'll find him spinning up design work for digital and print, producing live action or animating 2D video stories, and doing anything else that touches user experience. Shaun's aim is to craft clear stories that translate complex concepts through visuals and messaging for every audience. When he's not wrestling pixels or nerding out over typefaces he enjoys spending time with his wife and three children, playing guitar, enjoying all the Bay Area has to offer, and dabbling in cryptocurrency investing.
