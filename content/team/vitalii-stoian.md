Vitalii is a seasoned backend engineer with a passion for managing people. Along the path of his varied experience in developing products, tools, and frameworks, he has learned to enjoy relaxed and targeted coding. He is a fan of optimizing everything in both his technical and personal lives. For example, he particularly enjoys optimizing his driving by predicting others' maneuvers and practicing effortlessly smooth movements. Vitalii used to be reckless with his interests in extreme sports before he got married, but now he's a calm dad who likes to bike/roller skate/walk/play with the family.
