## What is a cluster?

In the context of PlanetScaleDB, a **cluster** is a set of resources that run one or more [databases](databases). Your application connects to a particular cluster, which provides access to all of the databases it contains.

Each cluster runs on one or more cloud providers and regions. The databases on a cluster can only deploy to the regions and providers for that cluster.

PlanetScale clusters correspond to [Kubernetes clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts), which PlanetScale uses to run your databases.
