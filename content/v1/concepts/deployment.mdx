## How does PlanetScaleDB deploy my database?

Because PlanetScaleDB is fully managed, PlanetScale deploys your entire database on our own private cloud. This includes all of the components of a Vitess installation, such as MySQL database instances, Vitess tablets, and datastores like etcd, along with proprietary PlanetScale components. Once deployed, you interact with your database using the PlanetScaleDB Console. Your application connects to the PlanetScale database using a standard MySQL connection string.
