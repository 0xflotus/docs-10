There are two different types of lockservers you can configure: global or cell-local.

Let's discuss how Vitess uses global vs local topology.

Vitess only uses the global lockserver for shared state that must be consistent across all cells of all regions.
This is because, in a multi-region Vitess cluster, the global lockserver is typically backed by
a quorum of members spread across regions, and using this cross-region quorum for
all topology information would incur unnecessary latency in many cases.
Examples of topology information that must be globally consistent include keyspace, shard, and VSchema records.

PSDB Operator also relies on global topology when it needs to coordinate global consensus around topology registration and pruning, resharding, and master failover in federated (multi-region) deployments.

In contrast, Vitess uses cell-local topology to store state that's only relevant to that specific cell.
Examples of this kind of state include the addresses of tablets in that cell
and copies of keyspace and VSchema records (SrvKeyspace and SrvVSchema, respectively)
used by vtgates running in that cell.

## Global Lockserver

You can set up a global lockserver in one of two ways:

1. As an external lockserver that is already deployed.
2. As an etcd lockserver that PSDB operator deploys on a user's behalf.

The most common way that people set up a global lockserver is to allow PSDB operator to deploy the lockserver on their behalf. Let's walk through how that works.

### Deployed Lockserver

You'll define the globalLockserver key on the spec key for your PlanetScaleCluster top-level CRD. You will choose the `etcd` field to indicate that you would like PSDB operator to deploy an etcd-based global lockserver on your behalf.

```yaml
spec:
  globalLockserver:
    etcd: {}
```

By leaving this as an empty object, you will allow PSDB operator to deploy an etcd-based lockserver using sane defaults. You can override these defaults by filling out optional fields to specify how you want your lockserver to be configured.

To read more about what various fields do and learn how to set them, please refer to the [API reference documentation](/psdb-operator/api).

### External Lockserver

If you have an externally managed lockserver, use the `external` key instead of the `etcd` key of the `globalLockserver` object.

```yaml
spec:
  globalLockserver:
    external:
      implementation: etcd2
      address: http://my-etcd-hostname:2379
      rootPath: /custom/path/prefix
```

To read more about what various fields do and learn how to set them, please refer to the [API reference documentation](/psdb-operator/api).

## Local Lockserver

Cell-local lockservers are optional. By default, if you don't configure a lockserver for a given cell, the data for that cell
will be stored in the global lockserver. Sharing the global lockserver in this way is usually sufficient for single-region clusters
and reduces unnecessary overhead.

If you do want to set up per-cell lockservers, which are recommended for multi-region clusters, you can add an EtcdLockserverTemplate to your cell
templates like such:

```yaml
spec:
  cells:
    - name: cellName
      zone: az
      lockserver:
        etcd: {}
```

Filling out the rest of this is the same as filling out the
EtcdLockserverTemplate for deploying a global lockserver. There is one caveat to keep
in mind for filling out the EtcdLockserverTemplate for a cell local lockserver. When supplying the `dataVolumeClaimTemplate` portion, you must set a storageClassName for a StorageClass that's configured to only provision volumes in the availability zone that corresponds to the Vitess Cell.

There is a simpler alternative, which is to set `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` in the StorageClass. This allows you to use the same
StorageClass for any availability zone.
