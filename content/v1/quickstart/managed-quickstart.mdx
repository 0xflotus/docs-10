## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, you must have a local installation of the MySQL command line interface. Download it [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html).

## Overview

This quickstart includes the following steps:

1. Create a PlanetScale account.
2. Create a cluster.
3. Create a database.
4. Find the MySQL connection string for your database.
5. Connect to your database using the MySQL command line tool.
6. Run a query against your database.

## 1. Create a PlanetScale account.

If you do not have a PlanetScale account, create one [here](https://console.planetscale.com/signup). Payment information is not necessary for this quickstart.

## 2. Create a cluster

After creating an account, the **Clusters** screen appears. Click **Create Cluster.** Each cluster runs one or more databases.

In the **Create New Cluster** pane, specify the name for your cluster and the cloud provider and region where you want the cluster to run.

## 3. Create a database

After creating a cluster, the **Overview** for your new cluster appears.

Click **Create Database**. In the **Create New Database** pane, specify the name for your database and the region where you want the database to run.

On the **Configure** screen, click **Create Database.** You do not need to change any of the default configuration options.

## 4. Find the MySQL connection string for your database.

After creating a database, the **Overview** for your new database appears. The current deployment status of your database appears in the **Status** pane. Your new database takes several minutes to deploy. When the status is "Deployed," you can connect to your new database.

To find the MySQL connection string for your database, click the **Connect** button in the upper-right of the **Overview** screen.

This displays the MySQL connection string for your database. This string contains the hostname, port number, user name, and password for your database. Click **Copy** to copy this string to your clipboard.

The connection string is formatted as follows:

```bash
$mysql --host {hostname} --port {port number} -p --user {username}
```

## 5. Connect to your database using the MySQL command line tool.

In your console, paste the connection string from your clipboard. Replace `{username}` with your [admin username](creating-database) and press enter. When the `mysql` client prompts you for a password, enter the password for your admin user.

You should see a MySQL shell prompt:

```console
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 83597
Server version: 5.7.9-Vitess

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
```

## 6. Run a query against your database.

Enter the following query against your PlanetScaleDB database:

```console
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

You should see a list of all of the databases in your [cluster](clusters):

```console
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+-----------+
| Databases |
+-----------+
| test1     |
| test3     |
+-----------+
```
