title: 'Update sharding scheme using DDL statements'
---

Before you can execute Sharding Scheme DDL statements in the MySQL terminal, you must grant the user sharding scheme DDL privileges via the [Advanced Cluster Configuration](configuring-cluster) option.

## Overview

This will cover some common use-cases for editing your Sharding Scheme:

1. How to Create a Primary Vindex
1. How to add a Vindex to a Table
1. How to Add a Secondary Vindex
1. How to Add a Sequence

## Creating a Primary Vindex

```sql
alter vschema create vindex VINDEX_NAME using VINDEX_TYPE
```

This command creates a Vindex called `VINDEX_NAME` of type `VINDEX_TYPE`. The full list of predefined Vindex types can be found in the open source [Vitess documentation for Vindexes](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vindexes/)

## How to add a Vindex to Table

```sql
alter vschema on TABLE_NAME add vindex VINDEX_NAME(`TABLE_COLUMN`)
```

This command adds the Vindex called `VINDEX_NAME` to the table `TABLE_NAME` on the column `TABLE_COLUMN`. In order to do this, the Vindex you are trying to add to the table already needs to exist.

## How to add a Secondary Vindex

[Secondary Vindexes](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vindexes/#secondary-vindexes) are additional Vindexes that are not the Primary Vindex. When applied from one column against another column of a table, they provide an optimization for WHERE clauses such that only the target shards where the data is present need to be queried.

To illustrate how to add a secondary Vindex, assume the that the current database already has a user table:

```sql
create table user(user_id bigint, name varchar(128), primary key(user_id));
```

To create a secondary Vindex for the `name` column against the `user_id` column, a lookup table needs to be created:

```sql
create table name_user_idx(name varchar(128), user_id bigint, primary key(name, user_id));
```

The lookup table contains only the two columns that are to be Vindexed against (`name` and `user_id`), and the primary key definition is a combination of those columns.

Next, create the Vindex and assign the appropriate `table`, `from`, `to`, and `owner` parameters:

```sql
alter vschema create vindex name_user_idx using lookup_hash with table=name_user_idx, from=name, to=user_id, owner=user
```

Finally, add `name_user_idx` Vindex onto the `name` column of the `user` table:

```sql
alter vschema on employees add vindex name_user_idx(`name`);
```

The resulting Sharding Scheme on your sharded keyspace should look like so:

```json
{
  "sharded": true,
  "vindexes": {
    "name_user_idx": {
      "type": "lookup_hash",
      "params": {
        "from": "name",
        "table": "name_user_idx",
        "to": "user_id"
      },
      "owner": "user"
    }
  },
  "tables": {
    "user": {
      "columnVindexes": [
        {
          "name": "name_user_idx",
          "columns": ["name"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## How to add a Sequence

It is currently not possible to add a sequence via DDL statements. See the [Vitess documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/) for defining a Sequence in the VSchema.
